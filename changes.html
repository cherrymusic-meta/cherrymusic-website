                    <li>
                        <p><b>Does CherryMusic alter my collection in any way?</b></p>
                        <p>Nope. For CherryMusic your collection <i>is and stays read-only</i>.
                        All the indices and additional meta-data are stored in
                        a folder in your home folder, specifically in the
                        <a href="http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html">
                            $XDG_DATA_HOME and $XDG_CONFIG_HOME</a> folders.
                        </p>

                        <p><b>I've started CherryMusic, but the search doesn't give any results!</b></p>
                        <p>Please make sure CherryMusic has already indexed your music. You can either
                        start it with the <code>--update</code> switch, or open the admin panel and click on
                        "Update Music Library"</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Can I use SSL/HTTPS?</b></p>
                        <p>Yes, you can. (see the man page/configuration file on how to set it up)</p>
                        <p>Note: If you're using python 2.x, please make sure to have pyOpenSSL installed</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Where's my config file?</b></p>
                        
                            <ul>
                                <li><p>On linux:</p>
                                    <p>Normally it's in <code>~/.config/cherrymusic</code><br/>
                                    If not, check where your $XDG_CONFIG_HOME points to.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li><p>On windows:</p>
                                    <p>You can find your config file in <code>%APPDATA%\cherrymusic</code>,
                                    e.g. C:\Users\1337hax0r\Application Data\cherrymusic</p>
                                </li>
                                <li><p>On OSX:</p>
                                <p>It is in <code>~/Application Support/cherrymusic</code></p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            </p>

                    <li>
                        <p><b>Is this CherryMusic yet another MPD?</b></p>
                        <p>No, not at all. MPD is a music server, that is able to play music and
                        which can be remote controlled by the clients. CherryMusic
                        is a mp3-Streaming server, that means that the clients will get to 
                        play to the music. This also means that you will be able to listen to your
                        music everywhere, as long as you have internet.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Are there Packages of this software for my Linux distro?</b></p>
                        <p>Yes. But right now only for Arch Linux.</p>
                        <p><a href="http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=62928">cherrymusic in the AUR</a></p>
                        <p>But it should be straight forward to create a package for your distro,
                        since the build system (distutils) is meant for that.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Does it work on Windows?</b></p>
                        <p>Yes. Or rather, probably yes. We're trying to test it on all platforms
                        but we don't have the time to check everything. Let us know if you experience any problems.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>What about OSX, does it work there?</b></p>
                        <p>Same as windows, but better; OSX is still *NIX, so I'd bet a chicken it runs just fine.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <a name="Issues"></a><h2>Issues</h2>
                    You've found a bug in CherryMusic? That's awesome. Tell us about it! You can open an issue in the <a href="https://github.com/devsnd/cherrymusic/issues">issue tracker of github</a> and we'll take care of it.
                
                <h2>Known Issues</h2>
                <h5>Flash block</h5>
                <p>An active flash blocker can interfere with the web frontend. 
                If you have trouble with things like track selection or playback, try whitelisting
                the server in your browser's flash blocker / plugin manager.</p>
                <h5>On Windows:</h5>
                <p>FileNotFoundError: [WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified:
                    'C:\...\cherrymusic\sessions\session-622d41384b5f877a840ba5dfe38408dc4853e8f4.lock'
                This error can be circumvented by setting the</p>
                <pre><code>keep_session_in_ram = True</code></pre>
                <p>in the configuration file (<code>%APPDATA%\cherrymusic\cherrymusic.conf</code>,
                                    e.g. C:\Users\1337hax0r\Application Data\cherrymusic\cherrymusic.conf)</p>
                
                <h5>Known Bugs</h5>
                <p>Currently there is a bug in cherrypy, the server framework cherrymusic was built upon, that prevents serving files that have non-ascii characters in their name. 
                I have already <a href="https://bitbucket.org/cherrypy/cherrypy/issue/1148/wrong-encoding-for-urls-containing-utf-8">filed a bug with a description of a 
                workaround</a> and I hope it will be resolved soon upstream.</p>
                <p>If you've found a bug, <b>please</b> <a href="http://www.github.com/devsnd/cherrymusic/issues">report it on github</a>. We want to make CherryMusic as cool as possible and need your help!</p>
