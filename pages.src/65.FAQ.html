        <p><b>I've started CherryMusic, but the search doesn't give any results!</b></p>
        <p>Well, that is not a question. Anyway, please make sure CherryMusic has already indexed your music. You can either
        start it with the <code>--update</code> switch, or open the admin panel and click on
        "Update Music Library"</p>

    <li>
        <p><b>Is this CherryMusic yet another MPD?</b></p>
        <p>No, not at all. MPD is a music server, that is able to play music and
        which can be remote controlled by the clients. CherryMusic
        is a mp3-Streaming server, that means that the clients will get to 
        play to the music. This also means that you will be able to listen to your
        music everywhere, as long as you have internet.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>Are there Packages of this software for my Linux distro?</b></p>
        <p>Yes. There is one for Arch Linux:</p>
        <p><a href="http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=62928">cherrymusic in the AUR</a></p>
        <p>And there is an ebuild for gentoo:</p>
        <p><a href="http://gpo.zugaina.org/media-sound/cherrymusic">Gentoo ebuild</a></li></p>
        <p>But it should be straight forward to create a package for your distro,
        since the python build system (distutils) is meant for that.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>Does it work on Windows?</b></p>
        <p>Yes. Or rather, probably yes. There's one known problem and a workaround for
        that (see the bottom of the page). We're trying to test it on all platforms
        but we don't have the time to check everything. Let us know if you experience
        any problems. I'd bet a chicken it runs just fine.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>What about OSX, does it work there?</b></p>
        <p>Yes. We try to test it once in a while on OSX and each time we do so everything
        worked. Please tell us if you experience any problems.</p>
    </li>
